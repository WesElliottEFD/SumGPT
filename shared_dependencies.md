Shared Dependencies:

1. `ApplicationOverview`: Information about the application's purpose, audience, and technology stack used across multiple documents for context.
2. `DataModelSchemas`: Definitions of data structures used in Entities, which are referenced in Use Cases, Interface Adapters, and Testing Methods.
3. `BusinessLogicFunctions`: Function names and descriptions from the Core Business Logic that are called or referenced in Use Cases, Interface Adapters, and Testing Methods.
4. `UseCaseDescriptions`: Descriptions of business processes that are referenced in Interface Adapters and Testing Methods for integration and validation purposes.
5. `InterfaceComponentIDs`: ID names of DOM elements used in Interface Adapters that JavaScript functions will interact with, potentially referenced in Testing Methods for UI tests.
6. `APIIntegrationDetails`: Information about external APIs from Frameworks and Drivers that are used in Interface Adapters and may require security considerations.
7. `SecurityProtocolNames`: Names of security protocols from Security and Authentication that are implemented in Interface Adapters and Frameworks and Drivers.
8. `AuthenticationFunctionNames`: Names of authentication functions that are used in Security and Authentication, potentially referenced in Interface Adapters and Frameworks and Drivers.
9. `TestingMethodNames`: Names of testing methods from Testing and Quality Assurance that are used to validate Entities, Use Cases, and Interface Adapters.
10. `BuildAutomationScripts`: Script names and descriptions from Build Process and Dependency Management that are used to compile and deploy the application, potentially referenced in Testing Methods.
11. `SharedLibraryNames`: Names of shared libraries or dependencies from Inter-component Relationships that are used across various components of the application.
12. `DocumentationFileNames`: Names of the Markdown files that are consistently used across the Documentation Assembly and Organization to ensure a coherent structure.
13. `MaintenanceStrategies`: Strategies for maintaining documentation that are outlined in Documentation and Knowledge Sharing and applied in Documentation Assembly and Organization.

These shared dependencies are the common elements that will be referenced or used across the generated Markdown files to ensure consistency and coherence in the documentation of the application's architecture and processes.
