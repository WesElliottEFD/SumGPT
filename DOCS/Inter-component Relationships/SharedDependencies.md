# Shared Dependencies

This document outlines the shared dependencies within the application, which is designed to enhance user engagement at events. These dependencies are crucial for maintaining the consistency and integrity of the application's architecture.

## Application Overview

For a comprehensive understanding of the application's purpose and audience, refer to the [Overview.md](../Introduction/Overview.md) document. It provides the necessary context for the shared dependencies listed below.

## Data Model Schemas

The data structures defined in [Entities.md](../Core%20Business%20Logic/Entities.md) are used across various components of the application. These schemas are essential for ensuring that data is consistently managed and validated throughout the application.

## Business Logic Functions

Function names and their descriptions are detailed in [Entities.md](../Core%20Business%20Logic/Entities.md). These functions are invoked by the business processes and are critical for the application's core functionality.

## Use Case Descriptions

Descriptions of the business processes can be found in [UseCases.md](../Business%20Processes/UseCases.md). These processes interact with the business logic and are integral to the application's operation.

## Interface Component IDs

The Interface Adapters utilize DOM element IDs defined in [InterfaceAdapters.md](../Data%20Conversion%20and%20User%20Interface/InterfaceAdapters.md) for user interaction. These IDs are also used in testing methods for UI tests.

## API Integration Details

External APIs integrated into the application are documented in [FrameworksAndDrivers.md](../External%20Communication/FrameworksAndDrivers.md). This information is vital for the Interface Adapters and security considerations.

## Security Protocol Names

Security protocols implemented throughout the application are listed in [SecurityProtocols.md](../Security%20and%20Authentication/SecurityProtocols.md). These protocols are enforced in various components to protect user data.

## Authentication Function Names

Authentication functions are detailed in [SecurityProtocols.md](../Security%20and%20Authentication/SecurityProtocols.md). These functions are used to manage user access and are referenced across the application.

## Testing Method Names

Testing methods are described in [TestingMethods.md](../Testing%20and%20Quality%20Assurance/TestingMethods.md). These methods are employed to validate the functionality of Entities, Use Cases, and Interface Adapters.

## Build Automation Scripts

The scripts used for building and deploying the application are outlined in [BuildProcedures.md](../Build%20Process%20and%20Dependency%20Management/BuildProcedures.md). These scripts are essential for the application's continuous integration and delivery.

## Shared Library Names

Shared libraries and dependencies are discussed in this document. They are used across various components and are crucial for the application's functionality and performance.

## Documentation File Names

The names of the Markdown files are standardized across the documentation to maintain a coherent structure. This document itself is named [SharedDependencies.md](./SharedDependencies.md) and resides within the "DOCS/Inter-component Relationships" folder.

## Maintenance Strategies

Strategies for maintaining the documentation are outlined in [DocumentationReview.md](../Documentation%20and%20Knowledge%20Sharing/DocumentationReview.md) and [DocumentationOrganization.md](../Documentation%20Assembly%20and%20Organization/DocumentationOrganization.md). These strategies ensure that the documentation remains up-to-date with the ongoing changes in the codebase.

By adhering to these shared dependencies, the application's architecture remains consistent, maintainable, and scalable, in line with Uncle Bob's 'Clean Architecture' principles.
