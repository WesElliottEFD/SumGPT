## Naming Conventions

- Each Markdown file is named to reflect its content and the section of the analysis it pertains to.
- Filenames are in PascalCase to maintain consistency and readability.

## Maintenance Strategy

- Documentation will be reviewed and updated on a bi-weekly basis to ensure it reflects the most recent changes in the codebase.
- Any updates to the documentation should be made in a new branch and merged into the main branch upon approval to maintain the integrity of the documentation.
- A changelog will be maintained within each Markdown file to track the history of changes.

## Collaboration and Sharing

- The documentation will be shared and collaboratively updated using [specify tool/platform], ensuring that all team members have access to the latest versions.
- Team members are encouraged to contribute to the documentation by submitting pull requests for review.

## Deadlines

- Deadlines for each section of the analysis are set to ensure timely progress and are tracked using [specify tool/platform].
- The deadlines for each section are as follows:

  | Section                                  | Deadline       |
