# Security Protocols

This document outlines the security protocols and authentication measures implemented in the application designed for enhancing user engagement at events. The application is structured using Clean Architecture principles, ensuring that security concerns are handled at the appropriate levels of the architecture.

## Overview

Security is a critical aspect of our application, ensuring that user data is protected and that access to various parts of the system is controlled and monitored. The following sections detail the security protocols and authentication measures in place.

## Authentication

### User Authentication

- **Protocol**: OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
- **Implementation**: Users are authenticated via external identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- **Function**: `AuthenticateUser` (referenced in `InterfaceAdapters.md` and `FrameworksAndDrivers.md`).

### Service Authentication

- **Protocol**: API keys and secret tokens.
- **Implementation**: Services authenticate with each other using environment-specific keys.
- **Function**: `AuthenticateService` (referenced in `FrameworksAndDrivers.md`).

## Authorization

- **Method**: Role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Implementation**: Users are assigned roles that determine their access levels.
- **Function**: `AuthorizeAccess` (referenced in `InterfaceAdapters.md`).

## Data Encryption

- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest.
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for data in transit.
- **Function**: `EncryptData`, `DecryptData` (referenced in `Entities.md` and `UseCases.md`).

## Security Auditing

- **Logs**: All access and operations are logged for auditing purposes.
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of security events.
- **Function**: `LogSecurityEvent` (referenced in `InterfaceAdapters.md`).

## Incident Response

- **Plan**: A detailed incident response plan is in place for security breaches.
- **Function**: `HandleSecurityIncident` (referenced in `InterfaceAdapters.md`).

## Compliance

- **Standards**: The application complies with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data protection regulations.
- **Function**: `EnsureCompliance` (referenced in `InterfaceAdapters.md`).

## Security Protocols Review

- **File**: `SecurityProtocolsReview.md` in `DOCS/Documentation and Knowledge Sharing`.
- **Purpose**: Regular review of security protocols to adapt to emerging threats.

## Conclusion

Security and authentication are integral to maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the application. The protocols and measures outlined here are subject to regular review and updates to address new security challenges.

For further details on the implementation of these protocols, refer to the respective functions and their usage in the application's codebase as indicated by the shared dependencies.
