# Business Processes (Use Cases)

This document provides a detailed analysis of the business processes, also known as use cases, that are integral to the application developed for enhancing user engagement at events. Each use case is designed to fulfill a specific part of the application's core functionality and interacts with the business logic to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Use Case Overview

The following use cases represent the business processes that the application supports:

- **Event Registration**: Allows users to register for an event.
- **User Check-In**: Facilitates the check-in process at the event venue.
- **Engagement Tracking**: Monitors and records user engagement activities during the event.
- **Feedback Collection**: Gathers feedback from users post-event.
- **Analytics Reporting**: Generates reports on user engagement and event performance.

## Detailed Use Cases

### Event Registration

- **Description**: Users can sign up for an event through the application. This process involves collecting user information and registering it in the system.
- **Primary Actors**: Event Attendees
- **Preconditions**: The event is open for registration.
- **Postconditions**: The user is registered for the event.
- **Main Flow**:
  1. The user selects an event to register for.
  2. The user provides necessary personal details.
  3. The system validates the information and registers the user.
  4. The user receives a confirmation of registration.

### User Check-In

- **Description**: On the day of the event, users can check in via the application using a QR code or other identifier.
- **Primary Actors**: Event Attendees
- **Preconditions**: The user is registered for the event.
- **Postconditions**: The user is marked as present at the event.
- **Main Flow**:
  1. The user presents the QR code at the event entrance.
  2. The system verifies the QR code.
  3. The user's attendance is recorded in the system.
  4. The user gains access to the event.

### Engagement Tracking

- **Description**: The application tracks various user activities to measure engagement during the event.
- **Primary Actors**: Event Organizers, Attendees
- **Preconditions**: The user is checked in at the event.
- **Postconditions**: User engagement data is collected.
- **Main Flow**:
  1. The user interacts with different event features (e.g., polls, quizzes).
  2. The system captures and logs these interactions.
  3. Engagement metrics are updated in real-time.

### Feedback Collection

- **Description**: After the event, the application allows users to provide feedback on their experience.
- **Primary Actors**: Event Attendees
- **Preconditions**: The event has concluded.
- **Postconditions**: User feedback is collected and stored.
- **Main Flow**:
  1. The user accesses the feedback form in the application.
  2. The user submits their feedback.
  3. The system stores the feedback for analysis.

### Analytics Reporting

- **Description**: The application generates analytics reports based on the data collected from user engagement and feedback.
- **Primary Actors**: Event Organizers
- **Preconditions**: There is sufficient data from the event.
- **Postconditions**: Reports are generated and can be accessed by organizers.
- **Main Flow**:
  1. The organizer requests a report via the application.
  2. The system processes the collected data.
  3. The system generates and presents the report.

## Integration with Business Logic

Each use case interacts with the core business logic to ensure data consistency and adherence to business rules. The `BusinessLogicFunctions` and `DataModelSchemas` from the Core Business Logic are utilized to process and manage the data flow within these use cases.
