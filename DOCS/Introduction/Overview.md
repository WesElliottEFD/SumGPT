# Application Overview

The purpose of this application is to enhance user engagement at events by providing an interactive and personalized experience for attendees. The application aims to facilitate engagement through features such as live polling, event-specific content sharing, and networking opportunities. The target audience includes event organizers who wish to increase participation and attendees seeking to make the most out of the events they attend.

## Technology Stack

The application is built using Python, a versatile programming language known for its readability and broad support of libraries. The choice of Python allows for rapid development and prototyping, which is essential in the dynamic field of event management.

## Development Challenges

One of the unique challenges in developing this application is ensuring that it can handle a large number of simultaneous users during peak event times without compromising performance. Additionally, the application must be intuitive for users of varying technical proficiency levels.

## Clean Architecture Compliance

In adherence to Uncle Bob's 'Clean Architecture' principles, the application's codebase is structured to separate concerns, promoting software scalability, maintainability, and the independence of business rules from the user interface. This approach ensures that the application can evolve over time without significant rework.

## Goals of the Analysis

This in-depth analysis of the codebase will document the current architecture, identify bottlenecks, and suggest areas for improvement. The analysis will include diagrams and flowcharts to visually represent the application's structure and workflows. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for optimizing and enhancing the architecture.
